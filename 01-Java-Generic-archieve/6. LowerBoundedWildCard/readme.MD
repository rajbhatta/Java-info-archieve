## Lower Bounded WildCard in Java ##
The Upper Bounded Wildcards section shows that an upper bounded wildcard restricts the unknown type to be a specific type or a subtype of that type and is represented using the extends keyword. In a similar way, a lower bounded wildcard restricts the unknown type to be a specific type or a super type of that type.

A lower bounded wildcard is expressed using the wildcard character ('?'), following by the super keyword, followed by its lower bound: <? super A>.


The question mark (?), represents the wildcard, stands for unknown type in generics. There may be times when you'll want to restrict the kinds of types that are allowed to be passed to a type parameter. For example, a method that operates on numbers might only want to accept instances of Integer or its superclasses like Number.

To declare a lower bounded Wildcard parameter, list the ?, followed by the super keyword, followed by its lower bound.

```js
package raj.javageneric;

import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

public class GenericsTester {

   public static void addCat(List<? super Cat> catList) {
      catList.add(new RedCat());
      System.out.println("Cat Added");
   }

   public static void main(String[] args) {
      List<Animal> animalList= new ArrayList<Animal>();
      List<Cat> catList= new ArrayList<Cat>();
      List<RedCat> redCatList= new ArrayList<RedCat>();
      List<Dog> dogList= new ArrayList<Dog>();

      //add list of super class Animal of Cat class
      addCat(animalList);

      //add list of Cat class
      addCat(catList);

      //compile time error
      //can not add list of subclass RedCat of Cat class
      //addCat(redCatList);

      //compile time error
      //can not add list of subclass Dog of Superclass Animal of Cat class
      //addCat.addMethod(dogList); 
   }
}
class Animal {}

class Cat extends Animal {}

class RedCat extends Cat {}

class Dog extends Animal {}
```
